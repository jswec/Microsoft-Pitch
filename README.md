# Microsoft Studios Pitch

**Author**: Russell Blanchard, Leo Schell, Christopher Swecker, Beyza Ulasti

## Overview

The folks over at Microsoft have decided to throw their hat into the ring and the movie business will never be the same. They've come to us to figure out their pivotal first moves, luckily we are up to the task and have the data to prove it. This project is a repository of our thoughts and opinions on where to go from here using the cleanest and most recent data available. We've used over three data sets meticulously cleaned and trimmed to show off three different options for the executives to take. We looked at the most profitable movies per dollar, the highest grossing, and how genre and producers can affect all. We've come to the conclusion that the most bang for your buck is horror, the second being childrens films, and last but not least the big summer action/adventure blockbusters. We think all three are great options, which is why we are delivering them in order of rate of return on investment.

## Business Problem

Microsoft wants to create a new studio to finally and only now at it's peak really capture the market on the movie industry, they want to know what type of films to focus on. To solve that for them, we've analyzed domestic and foreign gross, measured the profitability on rate of return per dollar spent, and how genre and rating factor in to finanical success.

## Data

Our data was generated from the website IMDb. IMDb (an initialism for Internet Movie Database) which is a website where you can find out that Elrond from Lord of the Rings also played the dog in Babe and Babe 2: Pig in the City. It also is a global online database of information related to movies, television, and videogames. We used box office gross, ratings, and producer credits to generate our findings.

## Methods

<<<<< Placeholder for Master Database info >>>>>>>


We then tidied it all up and removed all duplicates and null values, converted them to a more simple and readable format and cut out movies that came out over 5 years ago as the average development of a movie from inception to release is ~2 years and we are trying to touch upon trends, not miss them.

## Results
     
     <placeholder>
3 of the above graphs, Domestic Gross Sales, Foreign Gross Sales and Number of Votes clearly show that Adventure, Action and Sci-Fi combination are most successful in Domestic and Foreign Gross Sales and also in the average rating given. Its clear also to see that the adventure genre is popular across the board especially when elements of animation, action and or comedy are also included.

The 4th graph showing Top 20 Average Ratings shows Adventure as top as a solo genre.

To improve confidence in the results next time I would:-

Include the movie classification This could have narrowed down the target audience the most successful movies were aimed at i.e PG etc.

Broken the data into the relevant years to see if there are changes year by year in the top genres of movies, see if audience tastes change over time.

## Conclusions

Our analysis leads to three different avenues in which to proceed, none prohibit the other and can all be utilized if the budget allows.

This analysis leads to three recommendations regarding types of movies that are successful:-
Horror is a great way to dip your toe into the industry without a lot of capital committed, they have some of if not the highest rate of returns and result in some of the most negligible losses as they are often low risk but high reward.

Childrens films do extremely well even without high ratings so again a fairly safe bet to leap into as their rating emcompases the entire population

Action and Adventure are some of the highest grossing movies of all time, and will generate the most revenue if they are successful, however their budget is much higher than the horror and higher than childrens films, so while this is one of the riskier options, still extremely viable

Questions to consider:

Limitations- This data is valuable, but it does not measure product placement, and as much as I-phones find their way into movies we could do the same with.. Surfaces?
It doesn't account for merchandising, there is a large sum of money to be made from selling toys from childrens movies, less so from horror, further exploration of release month and bankable actors could lead to more precise and actionable data.

# Microsoft Studios Pitch

**Author**: Russell Blanchard, Leo Schell, Christopher Swecker, Beyza Ulasti

## Overview

The folks over at Microsoft have decided to throw their hat into the ring and the movie business will never be the same. They've come to us to figure out their pivotal first moves, luckily we are up to the task and have the data to prove it. This project is a repository of our thoughts and opinions on where to go from here using the cleanest and most recent data available. We've used over three data sets meticulously cleaned and trimmed to show off three different options for the executives to take. We looked at the most profitable movies per dollar, the highest grossing, and how genre and producers can affect all. We've come to the conclusion that the best choice to create a movie studio would be to focus on Action / Adventure films, based on an existing IP, with seasoned producers, and released in Q1 or Q2 will deliver the most return

## Business Problem

Microsoft wants to create a new studio to finally and only now at it's peak really capture the market on the movie industry, they want to know what type of films to focus on. To solve that for them, we've analyzed domestic and foreign gross, measured the profitability on rate of return per dollar spent, and how genre and rating factor in to finanical success.

## Business Problem

Microsoft wants to create a new studio to finally and only now at it's peak really capture the market on the movie industry, they want to know what type of films to focus on. To solve that for them, we've analyzed domestic and foreign gross, measured the profitability on rate of return per dollar spent, and how genre and rating factor in to finanical success.

## Bottom Line

1. Ip is King
2. Action and Adventure 
3. Seasoned Producers
4. Q1 or Q2 Release


We then tidied it all up and removed all duplicates and null values, converted them to a more simple and readable format and cut out movies that came out over 5 years ago as the average development of a movie from inception to release is ~2 years and we are trying to touch upon trends, not miss them.

## Data Understanding
     
The data that we used in our analysis was from https://www.imdb.com/, https://www.themoviedb.org/, and https://www.the-numbers.com/. These files provided movie metrics from everything from release dates, genre, box office gross, and countless other facets and avenues that we could've tread to support and cement our findings. It primarily contains numerical data, and categorical subsets. Through some careful cleaning and parsing we could ascertain what movies were the most popular, made the highest box office gross, and when they were released.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Create a movie based on existing Intellectual Property. It may not lend itself to artistry but the data doesn't lie, people like things they've seen before, it pulls in a massive pre-populated audience and creates a feedback loop on the existing property, synergy.

Focus on the Action and Adventure Genre. This genre of movie has been consistently the most popular with almost an 100% stranglehold on top box office gross and they have the largest audience and can appeal to multiple generations.

Hire the right people for the job. Producers matter, we need to people that understand how to successfuly adapt a pre-existing property into a cinematic format.

Release in Q1 or Q2. Movies released in these quarters profited the most.

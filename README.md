# Revitalize The Microsoft Brand Through Content Strategy

**Authors**: Russell Blanchard, Leo Schell, Christopher Swecker, Beyza Ulasti


## Overview

The folks over at Microsoft have decided to throw their hat into the ring and the movie business will never be the same. They've come to us to figure out their pivotal first moves, luckily we are up to the task and have the data to prove it.

This repository contains 

on where to go from here using the cleanest and most recent data available. We've used over three data sets meticulously cleaned and trimmed to show off three different options for the executives to take. We looked at the most profitable movies per dollar, the highest grossing, and how genre and producers can affect all. We've come to the conclusion that the most bang for your buck is horror, the second being childrens films, and last but not least the big summer action/adventure blockbusters. We think all three are great options, which is why we are delivering them in order of rate of return on investment.

Microsoft wants to create a new studio to finally and only now at it's peak really capture the market on the movie industry, they want to know what type of films to focus on. To solve that for them, we've analyzed domestic and foreign gross, measured the profitability on rate of return per dollar spent, and how genre and rating factor in to finanical success.


# Summary

We have determined that 

### The Bottom Line: Microsoft will revitalize their brand by leveraging an extensive portfolio of pre-existing Intellectual Property. This will have a profound impact on not only the brand's visibility, but on the business' bottom line as a whole.

## Data - RUSSEL

Our data was generated from the website IMDb. IMDb (an initialism for Internet Movie Database) which is a website where you can find out that Elrond from Lord of the Rings also played the dog in Babe and Babe 2: Pig in the City. It also is a global online database of information related to movies, television, and videogames. We used box office gross, ratings, and producer credits to generate our findings.

## Methods



We then tidied it all up and removed all duplicates and null values, converted them to a more simple and readable format and cut out movies that came out over 5 years ago as the average development of a movie from inception to release is ~2 years and we are trying to touch upon trends, not miss them.

## Data Analysis

### Action/Adventure is the most popular genre


### Of the most profitable movies, 9/10 were Action/Adventure movies based on previously established IP 


### Hollywood reuses the same producers for Action/Adventure films


### It may be industry standard to release an Action/Adventure film in Q1 or Q2







3 of the above graphs, Domestic Gross Sales, Foreign Gross Sales and Number of Votes clearly show that Adventure, Action and Sci-Fi combination are most successful in Domestic and Foreign Gross Sales and also in the average rating given. Its clear also to see that the adventure genre is popular across the board especially when elements of animation, action and or comedy are also included.

The 4th graph showing Top 20 Average Ratings shows Adventure as top as a solo genre.

To improve confidence in the results next time I would:-

Include the movie classification This could have narrowed down the target audience the most successful movies were aimed at i.e PG etc.

Broken the data into the relevant years to see if there are changes year by year in the top genres of movies, see if audience tastes change over time.

## Conclusions

Recommendations as follows:
* Slate Action/Adventure films based on previously established IP
* Recruit producers who have consistenly delivered high grossing content for franchises
* Slate content far in advance with Q1 or Q2 release dates


## Next Steps

* Research the value of merchandising based on previously established IP
* 
Limitations- This data is valuable, but it does not measure product placement, and as much as I-phones find their way into movies we could do the same with.. Surfaces?
It doesn't account for merchandising, there is a large sum of money to be made from selling toys from childrens movies, less so from horror, further exploration of release month and bankable actors could lead to more precise and actionable data.
